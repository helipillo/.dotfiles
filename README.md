# .dotfiles


##Â Brief description
Some days you just get tired of setting your code editor and your shell across your machines and/or servers. Today was one of these days.

##Installation
Just the usual clone
```shell
git clone https://github.com/helipillo/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

##Usage
The usage of this .dotfiles is as simple as it could be.
```shell
cd ~/.dotfiles
bash setup.sh
```
##Bonus Track
For the lazy console lovers, the setup will add and implement a executable to open a google window in your browser with the desired search query

###Usage
Type the following on your zsh console (e.g):
```shell
google "github/helipillo"
```
